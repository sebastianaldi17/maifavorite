# Supabase-Frontend (Vue)

A web app developed in Vue, bootstrapped using Vite, and uses Vuetify as the UI
framework.

# Initial setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

# Create production build

# To-do list

- Add import/export favorites (or collection system if already implemented)
- Add custom sort (ID, title, internal level)
- Add autocomplete suggestion for title & artist (and title kana when it is
  done)
- Add collection/playlist system, instead of just marking as favorite
