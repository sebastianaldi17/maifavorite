# Supabase-Frontend (Vue)

A web app developed in Vue, bootstrapped using Vite, and uses Vuetify as the UI
framework.

# Initial setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

# Create production build

Run `npm run build`. The static site should be on the `/dist` directory.

# To-do list

- Modify category & version filter so that multiple entries can be selected
  (like difficulty filter)
- Add title kana filter, because it is a hassle to type in hiragana just to
  search
- Add autocomplete suggestion for title & artist (and title kana when it is
  done)
- Add collection/playlist system, instead of just marking as favorite
