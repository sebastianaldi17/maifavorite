# Supabase-Frontend (Vue)

A web app developed in Vue, bootstrapped using Vite, and uses Vuetify as the UI
framework.

# Initial setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

# Create production build

Run `npm run build`. The static site should be on the `/dist` directory.

# To-do list

- Add import/export favorites (or collection system if already
  implemented)
- Add custom sort (ID, title, internal level)
- Add collection/playlist system, instead of just marking as favorite
- Merge v-chip logic instead of having it on 2 places at once
